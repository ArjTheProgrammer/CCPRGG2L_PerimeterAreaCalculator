in java, # Geometric Shapes Management Program

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with developing a program to manage various geometric shapes, including rectangles and circles. Each shape possesses unique characteristics and behaviors, such as specific dimensions and methods to calculate their area and perimeter. Your objective is to design a system that accurately computes the area and perimeter of each shape based on its properties, facilitating efficient geometric calculations in software applications.

## Requirements

### Shape Class
- Create a parent class named Shape that serves as the foundation for all geometric shapes.
- This class should include methods to calculate the area and perimeter of shapes.

### Rectangle Class
- Develop a subclass named Rectangle, which represents a rectangular shape.
- The class should contain attributes for length and width, along with methods to compute its area and perimeter based on these dimensions.

### Circle Class
- Implement another subclass named Circle, representing a circular shape.
- This class should include radius attribute and methods to compute its area and perimeter using the radius value.

### Main Program
- Create a main class named Main to test the functionality of the shape hierarchy.
- Instantiate objects of both Rectangle and Circle classes, providing specific dimensions (length, width, or radius) for each shape.
- Verify that the program accurately calculates and displays the area and perimeter for both shapes.

Ensure that the program adheres to object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, method overriding; promoting code reusability & maintainability. Additionally validate input parameters & handle potential errors gracefully ensuring robustness & reliability in geometric calculations.
